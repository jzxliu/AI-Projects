def min_fill_ordering(factor_list, variable_query):
    '''
    This function implements The Min Fill Heuristic. We will use this heuristic to determine the order 
    to eliminate the hidden variables. The Min Fill Heuristic says to eliminate next the variable that 
    creates the factor of the smallest size. If there is a tie, choose the variable that comes first 
    in the provided order of factors in factor_list.

    The returned list is determined iteratively.
    First, determine the size of the resulting factor when eliminating each variable from the factor_list.
    The size of the resulting factor is the number of variables in the factor.
    Then the first variable in the returned list should be the variable that results in the factor 
    of the smallest size. If there is a tie, choose the variable that comes first in the provided order of 
    factors in factor_list. 
    Then repeat the process above to determine the second, third, ... variable in the returned list.

    Here is an example.
    Consider our complete Holmes network. Suppose that we are given a list of factors for the variables 
    in this order: P(E), P(B), P(A|B, E), P(G|A), and P(W|A). Assume that our query variable is Earthquake. 
    Among the other variables, which one should we eliminate first based on the Min Fill Heuristic?Â 

    - Eliminating B creates a factor of 2 variables (A and E).
    - Eliminating A creates a factor of 4 variables (E, B, G and W).
    - Eliminating G creates a factor of 1 variable (A).
    - Eliminating W creates a factor of 1 variable (A).

    In this case, G and W tie for the best variable to be eliminated first since eliminating each variable 
    creates a factor of 1 variable only. Based on our tie-breaking rule, we should choose G since it comes 
    before W in the list of factors provided.

    NaiveBayesModel returns a BN that is a Naive Bayes model that represents

    Remember a Naive Bayes model assumes P(X1, X2,.... XN, Class) can be represented as 
    P(X1|Class) * P(X2|Class) * .... * P(XN|Class) * P(Class).

    When you generated your Bayes Net, assume that the values in the SALARY column of 
    the dataset are the CLASS that we want to predict.

    Please name the factors as follows. If you don't follow these naming conventions, you will fail our tests.
    - The name of the Salary factor should be called "Salary" without the quotation marks.
    - The name of any other factor should be called "VariableName,Salary" without the quotation marks. 
      For example, the factor for Education should be called "Education,Salary".
